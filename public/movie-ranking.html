<h1>The Best Movies According to Sean</h1>
<h2>My TOP 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sixteen Candles</h3>
<p>Between the great music that I didn't get to hear on the radio and seeing people on a screen dealing with the same things I was dealing with as a teenager. It was a movie for me. There wasn't really another movie that I, at that age, could relate to. I still watch this today and it takes me back to my youth. I can recite all the lines as the movie plays.</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>A movie about a man who lost everything in his native country and moved to the United States to build a better life for himself and his family, but to get that better life, he had to live a life of crime. A movie about the sins of the father. You want a better life for your children, but have no choice but to bring them into your crime drama just to eventually be killed or to kill each other. I love mobster movies and this is just perfectly written and acted. You want to like Marlon Brando's character because they present him as a family man, but then you have to keep reminding yourself he steals, deals and kills. He's not a good man. Not a good father.</p>
<h3>Gone In 60 Seconds</h3>
<p>Honestly, it's the cars. The cars in this movie are beautiful. I want to drive them all. It does have a great soundtrack as well. But the last, maybe 40 minutes or so of this movie, when they have to steal the cars to keep the main characters brother alive, it is super exciting. You're constantly thinking, don't get caught! It's an action movie as well as a romance movie, but the lucky ladies are the cars.</p>
